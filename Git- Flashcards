// All 61 flashcards
const flashcards = [
  {q:"What is the primary function of a Version Control System (VCS)?", a:"It records the changes made to code over time in a special database called a repository."},
  {q:"What problem does a VCS solve when multiple people work on the same project?", a:"It avoids manually merging changes and tossing code around via email, enabling effective collaboration."},
  {q:"In a _ version control system, all team members connect to a central server to get the latest code.", a:"centralized"},
  {q:"What is the main drawback of a centralized version control system?", a:"It has a single point of failure; if the server goes offline, collaboration stops."},
  {q:"How does a distributed version control system differ from a centralized one?", a:"Every team member has a full copy of the project history on their local machine, eliminating a single point of failure."},
  {q:"Name two examples of distributed version control systems.", a:"Git and Mercurial."},

  {q:"What command opens the global Git configuration file in your default editor?", a:"git config --global -e"},
  {q:"How should the core.autocrlf property be configured for a Windows user to handle line endings correctly?", a:"It should be set to true."},
  {q:"How should the core.autocrlf property be configured for a Mac or Linux user?", a:"It should be set to input."},
  {q:"What is the purpose of setting core.autocrlf to input on Mac/Linux systems?", a:"It ensures Git removes carriage return characters if they are accidentally added when storing code in the repository."},
  {q:"What command displays the full documentation for the git config command in the terminal?", a:"git config --help"},
  {q:"What command initializes a new, empty Git repository in the current directory?", a:"git init"},
  {q:"What is the name of the hidden subdirectory created by git init that contains the entire repository history?", a:".git"},
  {q:"What is the intermediate area in Git, between the working directory and the repository, called?", a:"The staging area (or index)."},
  {q:"What does the staging area in Git represent?", a:"It represents what you are proposing for the next commit or snapshot."},
  {q:"Describe the basic three-step Git workflow for saving changes.", a:"First, modify files in working directory; second, add to staging area; third, commit to repository."},
  {q:"What does a Git commit contain besides the changes made?", a:"A complete snapshot of the project at that point plus metadata like author, date, and unique ID."},
  {q:"What is a common misconception about the staging area after a commit is made?", a:"That it becomes empty; it actually holds the same snapshot as the last commit."},
  {q:"What command is used to view the status of the working directory and the staging area?", a:"git status"},
  {q:"What command adds all files with a .txt extension in the current directory to the staging area?", a:"git add *.txt"},
  {q:"What does the command git add . do?", a:"Adds the entire current directory and all subdirectories recursively to the staging area."},
  {q:"If you modify a file after adding it to the staging area, what must you do to include the latest changes in the next commit?", a:"Run git add on that file again to stage the new changes."},
  {q:"What command commits staged changes with the message \"Initial commit\"?", a:"git commit -m \"Initial commit\""},
  {q:"What happens when you run git commit without the -m option?", a:"It opens your default editor to write a detailed commit message."},
  {q:"According to best practices, in what tense should Git commit messages be written?", a:"Present tense (e.g., \"Fix bug\" instead of \"Fixed bug\")."},
  {q:"What is the best practice regarding the size and scope of a single commit?", a:"A commit should represent a single, logically separate change set and not be too large or too small."},
  {q:"What command allows you to stage all modified files and commit them in a single step?", a:"git commit -a -m \"Your message\""},
  {q:"To remove a file from a Git project, you must remove it from both the working directory and the _.", a:"staging area"},

  {q:"The Git command _ is a shortcut for renaming a file in both the working directory and the staging area.", a:"git mv"},
  {q:"What is the name of the special file used to tell Git to ignore certain files and directories?", a:".gitignore"},
  {q:"If a file has already been tracked by Git, will adding it to .gitignore cause Git to ignore future changes to it?", a:"No, Git continues to track the file unless removed from the staging area."},
  {q:"What command removes a file or directory from the staging area (index) but leaves it in the working directory?", a:"git rm --cached"},
  {q:"To recursively remove a directory from the index while keeping it locally, what command would you use?", a:"git rm -r --cached"},
  {q:"What command provides a compact, short-format summary of the repository's status?", a:"git status -s"},
  {q:"In the output of git status -s, what does a red M in the right column signify?", a:"The file is modified in the working directory but the changes have not been staged."},
  {q:"In the output of git status -s, what does a green A in the left column signify?", a:"A new file has been added to the staging area."},
  {q:"In the output of git status -s, what do two question marks ?? indicate?", a:"The file is untracked by Git."},
  {q:"What command shows the differences between your working directory and the staging area (i.e., unstaged changes)?", a:"git diff"},
  {q:"What command shows the differences between the staging area and the last commit (i.e., staged changes)?", a:"git diff --staged"},
